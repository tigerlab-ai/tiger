I was kind of sad about it, but also felt it was slightly amusing since it seemed a more extreme response than I would expect. I left after I was done and went back to the frame shop where there was a man waiting. After helping him for a few minutes, that very woman came up to him. She was his wife.

The scars don\u2019t even look like they came from a cat or thorn, so I\u2019m surprised no one has said anything. I think if you say something with enough confidence, and the fact that people are too lazy and/or not interested enough to really think about it, they just buy it. It can be exhausting though.\nAlthough I haven\u2019t had people (I can think of) look at me in any particular way since they seem to believe the stories I tell them about the scars, I\u2019ve had people give me looks and call me disgusting for the trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling) I struggle with.

It doesn't judge, it hasn't left/abandoned me; I can try and crowd it out but it sticks around. I also mostly avoid <Organization> to dodge suspicion and comments, quarantine has absolutely crushed that support so it comes in waves.

{"prompt": "Yes. I do too.\n\nEspecially cutting really deep to the point I would have to take myself to the hospital because I made a bloodbath for cutting my arm.\n\nIn reality, I do lines and go over them until I start to bleed obsessively, treat it immediately and then lie down for 10 minutes and realized what I have done and then just focus on the pain.\n\nLike, have you ever not had enough sleep and start to shake? Like, I have that now and again and not sure what causes it, I don't know if it's the lack of sleep or the self harming because when I never self harmed, I never felt like this but I feel like nearly everyday, I feel like this.

{"prompt": "I totally understand this, I'm constantly fluctuating between self harm and anorexia. When I'm doing okay-ish it's usually more minor sh and manageable eating disorder thoughts, but when I'm not doing okay (basically since the start of 2020) I bounce between extremes. Had a bad 6 months of my worst sh, covering myself in permanent scars, and then decided to try and stop. It was okay for a bit but then slowly the ED started sneaking up again. Now I'm back in deep anorexia. I'm sure if I manage to get out of this I'll slowly move back to SH again. It's a never ending cycle, and I'm sorry you're experiencing these feelings too. Not eating can definitely be self harm. It's most definitely part of why I do it, though I have a other more ED related reasons too.\n\nSpeaking purely from my experience, dealing with an eating disorder is much more scary and much more deadly. They're also surprisingly easy to develop once you get into a food restriction mindset like this. Not that I want to recommend you go back to cutting, but if you can find alternatives or ways to try and cope that don't involve a restrictive diet I highly *highly* encourage it. Self harm is definitely very dangerous and it covered me in scars and shame, but I have a strong feeling this eating disorder is straight up going to kill me, either in a year because I don't recover or in 30 years because I do but my aging body can't handle all the damage not feeding it caused.", "V": 0, "HR": 0, "SH": 1, "V2": 0, "S": 0, "H": 0, "S3": 0, "H2": 0}
{"prompt": "I can really relate to this. I haven't self harmed in a month. Yayyyy so I feel shitty and tired all the time. What's the point????? I just think about killing myself more than if I self harmed. Is it really worth it to be clean???", "V": 0, "HR": 0, "SH": 1, "V2": 0, "S": 0, "H": 0, "S3": 0, "H2": 0}
